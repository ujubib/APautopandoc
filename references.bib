The model makes use of detailed structural information and treats solvation self-energies and interactions arising from permanent partial charges and titratable charges. Both the tetragonal and triclinic crystal structures a r e analyzed. Half of the experimentally observed pKa shifts (1 1 out of 21) a r e well reproduced by calculations for both structures; this includes the unusually high pKa of Glu 35 in the active site. For more than half the pK,'s (13 out of 21), there is a large difference (1-3.3 pK units) between the results from the two structures. Many of these correspond to the titrating groups for which the calculations are in error. Since for a n ionic strength of 0.1 M the Debye screening between titratable groups leads to a very high effective dielectric constant (the average value for all pairs of titrating groups is approximately 900), near-neighbor interactions dominate the pKa perturbations. Thus, the pKa values are very sensitive to the details of the local protein conformation, and it is likely that side-chain mobility has a n important role in determining the observed pKa shifts.},

These include time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), complete-active-space second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2), equation-of-motion coupled cluster (EOM-CC), and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. We find that all approaches give roughly the same vertical excitation for the anionic form, while TDDFT predicts an excitation for the neutral chromophore significantly lower than the highly correlated methods. Our findings support the picture emerging from the extrapolation of the Kamlet-Taft fit of absorption experimental data in solution and indicate that the protein gives rise to a considerable bathochromic shift with respect to vacuum. These results also open some questions on the interpretation of photodestruction spectroscopy experiments in the gas phase as well as on the accuracy of previous theoretical calculations in the more complex protein environment.},

Unfortunately, these methodologies are complex, involve multiple steps and require considerable investment of effort.

Protons are added to the input structure according to the calculated ionization states of its titratable groups at the user-specified pH; the output is in the PQR (PDB 1 charges 1 radii) format. In addition, corresponding coordinate and topology files are generated in the format supported by the molecular modeling package AMBER.

Protein-environmental effect on the excitation and fluorescence energies was investigated. In green fluorescent protein (GFP), the overall protein-environmental effect on the first excitation energy is not significant. However, glutamine (Glu) 94 and arginine (Arg96) have the red-shift contribution as reported in a previous study (Laino et al., Chem Phys 2004, 298, 17). The excited states of GFP active site (GFP-W22-Ser205-Glu222Ser65) were also calculated. Such large-scale SAC-CI calculations were performed with an improved code containing a new algorithm for the perturbation selection. The SAC-CI results indicate that a charge-transfer state locates at 4.19 eV, which could be related to the channel of the photochemistry as indicated in a previous experimental study. We also studied the excitation and fluorescence energies of blue fluorescent protein, cyan fluorescent protein, and Y66F. The SAC-CI results are very close to the experimental ones. The protonation state of blue fluorescent protein was determined. Conformation of cyan fluorescent protein indicated by the present calculation agrees to the experimentally observed structure.},

  abstract = {The crystal structure of the cyan-fluorescent Cerulean green fluorescent protein (GFP), a variant of enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP), has been determined to 2.0 \AA. Cerulean bears an internal fluorophore composed of an indole moiety derived from Y66W, conjugated to the GFP-like imidazolinone ring via a methylene bridge. Cerulean undergoes highly efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to yellow acceptor molecules and exhibits significantly reduced excited-state heterogeneity. This feature was rationally engineered in ECFP by substituting His148 with an aspartic acid [Rizzo et al. (2004) Nat. Biotechnol. 22, 445], rendering Cerulean useful for fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The X-ray structure is consistent with a single conformation of the chromophore and surrounding residues and may therefore provide a structural rationale for the previously described monoexponential fluorescence decay. Unexpectedly, the carboxyl group of H148D is found in a buried position, directly contacting the indole nitrogen of the chromophore via a bifurcated hydrogen bond. Compared to the similarly constructed ECFP chromophore, the indole group of Cerulean is rotated around the methylene bridge to adopt a cis-coplanar conformation with respect to the imidazolinone ring, resulting in a close edge-to-edge contact of the two ring systems. The double-humped absorbance spectrum persists in singlecrystal absorbance measurements, casting doubt on the idea that ground state conformational heterogeneity forms the basis of the two overlapping transitions. At low pH, a blue shift in absorbance of 10-15 nm suggests a pH-induced structural transition that proceeds with a time constant of 47 ((2) min and is reversible. Possible interpretations in terms of chromophore isomerization are presented.},

  abstract = {Fluorescent proteins have been widely used as genetically encodable fusion tags for biological imaging. Recently, a new class of fluorescent proteins was discovered that can be reversibly light-switched between a fluorescent and a nonfluorescent state. Such proteins can not only provide nanoscale resolution in far-field fluorescence optical microscopy much below the diffraction limit, but also hold promise for other nanotechnological applications, such as optical data storage. To systematically exploit the potential of such photoswitchable proteins and to enable rational improvements to their properties requires a detailed understanding of the molecular switching mechanism, which is currently unknown. Here, we have studied the photoswitching mechanism of the reversibly switchable fluoroprotein asFP595 at the atomic level by multiconfigurational ab initio (CASSCF) calculations and QM/MM excited state molecular dynamics simulations with explicit surface hopping. Our simulations explain measured quantum yields and excited state lifetimes, and also predict the structures of the hitherto unknown intermediates and of the irreversibly fluorescent state. Further, we find that the proton distribution in the active site of the asFP595 controls the photochemical conversion pathways of the chromophore in the protein matrix. Accordingly, changes in the protonation state of the chromophore and some proximal amino acids lead to different photochemical states, which all turn out to be essential for the photoswitching mechanism. These photochemical states are (i) a neutral chromophore, which can trans-cis photoisomerize, (ii) an anionic chromophore, which rapidly undergoes radiationless decay after excitation, and (iii) a putative fluorescent zwitterionic chromophore. The overall stability of the different protonation states is controlled by the isomeric state of the chromophore. We finally propose that radiationinduced decarboxylation of the glutamic acid Glu215 blocks the proton transfer pathways that enable the deactivation of the zwitterionic chromophore and thus leads to irreversible fluorescence. We have identified the tight coupling of trans-cis isomerization and proton transfers in photoswitchable proteins to be essential for their function and propose a detailed underlying mechanism, which provides a comprehensive picture that explains the available experimental data. The structural similarity between asFP595 and other fluoroproteins of interest for imaging suggests that this coupling is a quite general mechanism for photoswitchable proteins. These insights can guide the rational design and optimization of photoswitchable proteins.},

  abstract = {Green fluorescent protein and its mutants have become valuable tools in molecular biology. They also provide systems rich in photophysical and photochemical phenomena of which an understanding is important for the development of new and optimized variants of GFP. Surprisingly, not a single NMR study has been reported on GFPs until now, possibly because of their high tendency to aggregate. Here, we report the 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies on mutants of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) labeled with fluorinated tryptophans that enabled the detection of slow molecular motions in these proteins. The concerted use of dynamic NMR and 19F relaxation measurements, supported by temperature, concentration- and folding-dependent experiments provides direct evidence for the existence of a slow exchange process between two different conformational states of CFP. 19F NMR relaxation and line shape analysis indicate that the time scale of exchange between these states is in the range of 1.2-1.4 ms. Thermodynamic analysis revealed a difference in enthalpy {$\increment$}H0 ) (18.2 ( 3.8) kJ/mol and entropy T{$\increment$}S0 ) (19.6 ( 1.2) kJ/mol at T ) 303 K for the two states involved in the exchange process, indicating an entropy-enthalpy compensation. The free energy of activation was estimated to be approximately 60 kJ/mol. Exchange between two conformations, either of the chromophore itself or more likely of the closely related histidine 148, is suggested to be the structural process underlying the conformational mobility of GFPs. The possibility to generate a series of single-atom exchanges (``atomic mutations'') like H f F in this study offers a useful approach for characterizing and quantifying dynamic processes in proteins by NMR.},

Its amazing ability to generate a highly visible, efficiently emitting internal fluorophore is both intrinsically fascinating and tremendously valuable. High-resolution crystal structures of GFP offer unprecedented opportunities to understand and manipulate the relation between protein structure and spectroscopic function. GFP has become well established as a marker of gene expression and protein targeting in intact cells and organisms. Mutagenesis and engineering of GFP into chimeric proteins are opening new vistas in physiological indicators, biosensors, and photochemical memories.},

The starting hypothesis is that the quenching of fluorescence is related to the internal motion of the chromophore, usually called `u torsion'. In fact, that motion is hindered by the protein and cannot be studied by standard molecular dynamics. Therefore we have developed a different approach involving three steps.},

  abstract = {We have studied the fluorescence decays of the purified enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP, with chromophore sequence Thr-Trp-Gly) and of its variant carrying the single H148D mutation characteristic of the brighter form Cerulean. Both proteins exhibit highly complex fluorescence decays showing strong temperature and pH dependences. At neutral pH, the H148D mutation leads (i) to a general increase in all fluorescence lifetimes and (ii) to the disappearance of a subpopulation, estimated to be more than 25\% of the total ECFP molecules, characterized by a quenched and red-shifted fluorescence. The fluorescence lifetime distributions of ECFP and its H148D mutant remain otherwise very similar, indicating a high degree of structural and dynamic similarity of the two proteins in their major form. From thermodynamic analysis, we conclude that the multiexponential decay of ECFP cannot be simply ascribed, as is generally admitted, to the slow conformational exchange characterized by NMR and X-ray crystallographic studies [Seifert, M. H., et al. (2002) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 124, 7932-7942; Bae, J. H., et al. (2003) J. Mol. Biol. 328, 1071-1081]. Parallel measurements in living cells show that these fluorescence properties in neutral solution are very similar to those of cytosolic ECFP.},

  abstract = {Background: Because of its ability to spontaneously generate its own fluorophore, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria is used extensively as a fluorescent marker in molecular and cell biology. The yellow fluorescent proteins (YFPs) have the longest wavelength emissions of all GFP variants examined to date. This shift in the spectrum is the result of a T203Y substitution (single-letter amino acid code), a mutation rationally designed on the basis of the X-ray structure of GFP S65T. Results: We have determined the crystal structures of YFP T203Y/S65G/V68L/S72A and YFP H148G to 2.5 and 2.6 \AA{} resolution, respectively. Both structures show clear electron density for nearly coplanar {$\pi$}\textendash{$\pi$} stacking between Tyr203 and the chromophore. The chromophore has been displaced by nearly 1 \AA{} in comparison to other available structures. Although the H148G mutation results in the generation of a solvent channel to the chromophore cavity, intense fluorescence is maintained. The chromophore in the intact protein can be titrated, and the two variants have pKa values of 7.0 (YFP) and 8.0 (YFP H148G).

The altered location of the chromophore suggests that the exact positions of nearby residues are not crucial for the chemistry of chromophore formation. The YFPs significantly extend the pH range over which GFPs may be employed as pH indicators in live cells.},
