## Introduction

Variants of the wild-type Green Fluorescent Protein (wt-GFP) are widely used asin vivo fluorescent markers.
They can be fused to proteins of interest andthen allow for monitoring of cellular events by appropriate imaging techniques.
In techniques based on FRET (Förster resonance energy transfer), the Enhanced Cyan Fluorescent Protein (ECFP) is extensively used as donor partner.
However,ECFP presents suboptimal fluorescence properties, with a rather low quantum yield (near 0.4) and a non exponential fluorescence decay profile.

Cerulean is a variant of ECFP obtained by the three mutations S72A/Y145A/H148D, the last one (H148D) being specifically designed to avoid the existence of the two conformations found in ECFP.
Cerulean as well as the ECFP/H148D mutant were shown to have an improved quantum yield (respectively 0.62 and 0.68) and a more homogeneous fluorescence decay.

## Experiment

wt-GFP and all its variants present the same overall structure, a 11-stranded ß-barrel.
The chromophore, carried by a central a-helix, is autocatalytically formed in a post-translational reaction between three amino acids: Ser65-Tyr66-Gly67 in the case of wt-GFP, Thr65-Trp66-Gly67 in the case of ECFP, and Cerulean. In all GFP variants, the b-barrel presents a cleft between two strands geometrically close to the chromophore.

The X-ray structure of Cerulean has been determined at pH 5.0 revealing several striking aspects.
The chromophore is found in the cis conformation (according to the nomenclature used by Malo et al., which we will use throughout here, although it is mostly used for rotation around a double bond; (see Fig. 1) instead of trans in ECFP (X-ray structure at pH = 8.0).
The lateral chain of the aspartic acid in position 148 (Asp148) which was expected to be exposed to the solvent is found inside the protein and stabilizes the chromophore by hydrogen bonds (H-bond).
In addition, the distance between one of the carboxylic oxygen and the backbone oxygen of Asp148 is 2.87 Å.
Consistently, the authors infer that these two oxygens are hydrogen bonded and that Asp148 is protonated; we will henceforth refer to that interpretation as the intra-residue H-bond hypothesis.
Another interesting feature is that the cleft is significantly wider than in the other GFP variants.

In the same work, absorbance and fluorescence measurements show that the double-humped absorption spectrum in solution presents a blue shift of 11 and 15 nm occurring on the time scale of 1 h and that the fluorescence intensity decreases about 4-fold when the pH is lowered from 8.0 to 5.0.
Concerning the origin of the blue shift, the authors rule out a change in the protonation state of the chromophore and retain two hypotheses: a local reorganization of the proton distribution of the neighbor residues and/or an isomerization of the chromophore.

Theoretical results reported in the literature are in favor of the chromophore isomerization hypothesis.
Indeed, quantum chemical calculations of the absorption wavelength of different conformations of the chromophore in gas phase show that
a blue shift occurs when switching from the trans conformation to the cis conformation.
The calculated values are of the same order of magnitude as the experimental blue shift observed inside the protein: 13-18 nm and 20 nm.
However, these results are not sufficient to confirm the hypothesis of
chromophore isomerization since they do not include the effect of the protein matrix.

## Results

The chromophore isomerization has appeared as a very important feature in the family of GFP.
It is a key factor in the photoswitching process of GFP-like proteins, asFP595 and Dronpa for instance, but it is then induced by light irradiation and it has been associated with a change in the protonation state of the chromophore itself.
A change in the conformation of the chromophore induced by a pH variation has also been reported in the case of the chromoprotein Rtms5.
At pH 8.0, this protein is non fluorescent, with the chromo phore in a trans non-coplanar conformation, whereas it is fluorescent at pH 10.7, the chromophore being distributed between a trans noncoplanar form and a cis coplanar form (note that the meaning of cis and trans is not the same as in the present work).
