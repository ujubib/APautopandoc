Many of these correspond to the titrating groups for which the calculations are in error. Since for a n ionic strength of 0.1 M the Debye screening between titratable groups leads to a very high effective dielectric constant (the average value for all pairs of titrating groups is approximately 900), near-neighbor interactions dominate the pKa perturbations. Thus, the pKa values are very sensitive to the details of the local protein conformation, and it is likely that side-chain mobility has a n important role in determining the observed pKa shifts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Bashford","given":"Donald"},{"family":"Karplus","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"bashfordPKaIonizableGroups1990","container-title":"Biochemistry","container-title-short":"Biochemistry","DOI":"10.1021/bi00496a010","ISSN":"0006-2960, 1520-4995","issue":"44","issued":{"date-parts":[[1990,11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"10219-10225","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"pKa's of ionizable groups in proteins: atomic detail from a continuum electrostatic model","title-short":"pKa's of ionizable groups in proteins","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi00496a010","volume":"29"},

The SAC-CI results indicate that a charge-transfer state locates at 4.19 eV, which could be related to the channel of the photochemistry as indicated in a previous experimental study. We also studied the excitation and ﬂuorescence energies of blue ﬂuorescent protein, cyan ﬂuorescent protein, and Y66F. The SAC-CI results are very close to the experimental ones.

  {"id":"maloXrayStructureCerulean2007","abstract":"The crystal structure of the cyan-fluorescent Cerulean green fluorescent protein (GFP), a variant of enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP), has been determined to 2.0 Å. Cerulean bears an internal fluorophore composed of an indole moiety derived from Y66W, conjugated to the GFP-like imidazolinone ring via a methylene bridge. Cerulean undergoes highly efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to yellow acceptor molecules and exhibits significantly reduced excited-state heterogeneity. This feature was rationally engineered in ECFP by substituting His148 with an aspartic acid [Rizzo et al. (2004) Nat. Biotechnol. 22, 445], rendering Cerulean useful for fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The X-ray structure is consistent with a single conformation of the chromophore and surrounding residues and may therefore provide a structural rationale for the previously described monoexponential fluorescence decay. Unexpectedly, the carboxyl group of H148D is found in a buried position, directly contacting the indole nitrogen of the chromophore via a bifurcated hydrogen bond. Compared to the similarly constructed ECFP chromophore, the indole group of Cerulean is rotated around the methylene bridge to adopt a cis-coplanar conformation with respect to the imidazolinone ring, resulting in a close edge-to-edge contact of the two ring systems. The double-humped absorbance spectrum persists in singlecrystal absorbance measurements, casting doubt on the idea that ground state conformational heterogeneity forms the basis of the two overlapping transitions. At low pH, a blue shift in absorbance of 10-15 nm suggests a pH-induced structural transition that proceeds with a time constant of 47 ((2) min and is reversible. Possible interpretations in terms of chromophore isomerization are presented.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Malo","given":"Gabrielle D."},{"family":"Pouwels","given":"Lauren J."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Meitian"},{"family":"Weichsel","given":"Andrzej"},{"family":"Montfort","given":"William R."},{"family":"Rizzo","given":"Mark A."},{"family":"Piston","given":"David W."},{"family":"Wachter","given":"Rebekka M."}],"citation-key":"maloXrayStructureCerulean2007","container-title":"Biochemistry","container-title-short":"Biochemistry","DOI":"10.1021/bi602664c","ISSN":"0006-2960, 1520-4995","issue":"35","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"9865-9873","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"X-ray Structure of Cerulean GFP: A Tryptophan-Based Chromophore Useful for Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging <sup>,</sup>","title-short":"X-ray Structure of Cerulean GFP","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/bi602664c","volume":"46"},

  {"id":"schaferChromophoreProtonationState2008","abstract":"Fluorescent proteins have been widely used as genetically encodable fusion tags for biological imaging. Recently, a new class of fluorescent proteins was discovered that can be reversibly light-switched between a fluorescent and a nonfluorescent state. Such proteins can not only provide nanoscale resolution in far-field fluorescence optical microscopy much below the diffraction limit, but also hold promise for other nanotechnological applications, such as optical data storage. To systematically exploit the potential of such photoswitchable proteins and to enable rational improvements to their properties requires a detailed understanding of the molecular switching mechanism, which is currently unknown. Here, we have studied the photoswitching mechanism of the reversibly switchable fluoroprotein asFP595 at the atomic level by multiconfigurational ab initio (CASSCF) calculations and QM/MM excited state molecular dynamics simulations with explicit surface hopping. Our simulations explain measured quantum yields and excited state lifetimes, and also predict the structures of the hitherto unknown intermediates and of the irreversibly fluorescent state. Further, we find that the proton distribution in the active site of the asFP595 controls the photochemical conversion pathways of the chromophore in the protein matrix. Accordingly, changes in the protonation state of the chromophore and some proximal amino acids lead to different photochemical states, which all turn out to be essential for the photoswitching mechanism. These photochemical states are (i) a neutral chromophore, which can trans-cis photoisomerize, (ii) an anionic chromophore, which rapidly undergoes radiationless decay after excitation, and (iii) a putative fluorescent zwitterionic chromophore. The overall stability of the different protonation states is controlled by the isomeric state of the chromophore. We finally propose that radiationinduced decarboxylation of the glutamic acid Glu215 blocks the proton transfer pathways that enable the deactivation of the zwitterionic chromophore and thus leads to irreversible fluorescence. We have identified the tight coupling of trans-cis isomerization and proton transfers in photoswitchable proteins to be essential for their function and propose a detailed underlying mechanism, which provides a comprehensive picture that explains the available experimental data. The structural similarity between asFP595 and other fluoroproteins of interest for imaging suggests that this coupling is a quite general mechanism for photoswitchable proteins. These insights can guide the rational design and optimization of photoswitchable proteins.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Schäfer","given":"Lars V."},{"family":"Groenhof","given":"Gerrit"},{"family":"Boggio-Pasqua","given":"Martial"},{"family":"Robb","given":"Michael A."},{"family":"Grubmüller","given":"Helmut"}],"citation-key":"schaferChromophoreProtonationState2008","container-title":"PLoS Computational Biology","container-title-short":"PLoS Comput Biol","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000034","editor":[{"family":"Warshel","given":"Arieh"}],"ISSN":"1553-7358","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,3,28]]},"language":"en","page":"e1000034","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Chromophore Protonation State Controls Photoswitching of the Fluoroprotein asFP595","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000034","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"seifertSlowExchangeChromophore2002","abstract":"Green fluorescent protein and its mutants have become valuable tools in molecular biology. They also provide systems rich in photophysical and photochemical phenomena of which an understanding is important for the development of new and optimized variants of GFP. Surprisingly, not a single NMR study has been reported on GFPs until now, possibly because of their high tendency to aggregate. Here, we report the 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies on mutants of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) labeled with fluorinated tryptophans that enabled the detection of slow molecular motions in these proteins. The concerted use of dynamic NMR and 19F relaxation measurements, supported by temperature, concentration- and folding-dependent experiments provides direct evidence for the existence of a slow exchange process between two different conformational states of CFP. 19F NMR relaxation and line shape analysis indicate that the time scale of exchange between these states is in the range of 1.2-1.4 ms. Thermodynamic analysis revealed a difference in enthalpy ∆H0 ) (18.2 ( 3.8) kJ/mol and entropy T∆S0 ) (19.6 ( 1.2) kJ/mol at T ) 303 K for the two states involved in the exchange process, indicating an entropy-enthalpy compensation. The free energy of activation was estimated to be approximately 60 kJ/mol. Exchange between two conformations, either of the chromophore itself or more likely of the closely related histidine 148, is suggested to be the structural process underlying the conformational mobility of GFPs. The possibility to generate a series of single-atom exchanges (“atomic mutations”) like H f F in this study offers a useful approach for characterizing and quantifying dynamic processes in proteins by NMR.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Seifert","given":"Markus H.

High-resolution crystal structures of GFP offer unprecedented opportunities to understand and manipulate the relation between protein structure and spectroscopic function.

The starting hypothesis is that the quenching of ﬂuorescence is related to the internal motion of the chromophore, usually called ‘u torsion’. In fact, that motion is hindered by the protein and cannot be studied by standard molecular dynamics. Therefore we have developed a different approach involving three steps.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Vallverdu","given":"G."},{"family":"Demachy","given":"I."},{"family":"Ridard","given":"J."},{"family":"Lévy","given":"B."}],"citation-key":"vallverduUsingBiasedMolecular2009","container-title":"Journal of Molecular Structure: THEOCHEM","container-title-short":"Journal of Molecular Structure: THEOCHEM","DOI":"10.1016/j.theochem.2008.07.012","ISSN":"01661280","issue":"1-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,3]]},"language":"en","page":"73-81","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Using biased molecular dynamics and Brownian dynamics in the study of fluorescent proteins","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166128008004016","volume":"898"},
  {"id":"villoingComplexFluorescenceCyan2008","abstract":"We have studied the ﬂuorescence decays of the puriﬁed enhanced cyan ﬂuorescent protein (ECFP, with chromophore sequence Thr-Trp-Gly) and of its variant carrying the single H148D mutation characteristic of the brighter form Cerulean. Both proteins exhibit highly complex ﬂuorescence decays showing strong temperature and pH dependences. At neutral pH, the H148D mutation leads (i) to a general increase in all ﬂuorescence lifetimes and (ii) to the disappearance of a subpopulation, estimated to be more than 25% of the total ECFP molecules, characterized by a quenched and red-shifted ﬂuorescence. The ﬂuorescence lifetime distributions of ECFP and its H148D mutant remain otherwise very similar, indicating a high degree of structural and dynamic similarity of the two proteins in their major form. From thermodynamic analysis, we conclude that the multiexponential decay of ECFP cannot be simply ascribed, as is generally admitted, to the slow conformational exchange characterized by NMR and X-ray crystallographic studies [Seifert, M. H., et al. (2002) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 124, 7932-7942; Bae, J. H., et al. (2003) J. Mol. Biol. 328, 1071-1081].

  {"id":"wachterStructuralBasisSpectral1998","abstract":"Background: Because of its ability to spontaneously generate its own fluorophore, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria is used extensively as a fluorescent marker in molecular and cell biology. The yellow fluorescent proteins (YFPs) have the longest wavelength emissions of all GFP variants examined to date. This shift in the spectrum is the result of a T203Y substitution (single-letter amino acid code), a mutation rationally designed on the basis of the X-ray structure of GFP S65T.\nResults: We have determined the crystal structures of YFP T203Y/S65G/V68L/S72A and YFP H148G to 2.5 and 2.6 Å resolution, respectively. Both structures show clear electron density for nearly coplanar π–π stacking between Tyr203 and the chromophore. The chromophore has been displaced by nearly 1 Å in comparison to other available structures. Although the H148G mutation results in the generation of a solvent channel to the chromophore cavity, intense fluorescence is maintained. The chromophore in the intact protein can be titrated, and the two variants have pKa values of 7.0 (YFP) and 8.0 (YFP H148G).

The altered location of the chromophore suggests that the exact positions of nearby residues are not crucial for the chemistry of chromophore formation. The YFPs significantly extend the pH range over which GFPs may be employed as pH indicators in live cells.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Wachter","given":"Rebekka M"},{"family":"Elsliger","given":"Marc-André"},{"family":"Kallio","given":"Karen"},{"family":"Hanson","given":"George T"},{"family":"Remington","given":"S James"}],"citation-key":"wachterStructuralBasisSpectral1998","container-title":"Structure","container-title-short":"Structure","DOI":"10.1016/S0969-2126(98)00127-0","ISSN":"09692126","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998,10]]},"language":"en","page":"1267-1277","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Structural basis of spectral shifts in the yellow-emission variants of green fluorescent protein","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0969212698001270","volume":"6"},
